# üì¶ SchemaFirst: Smart System for Dynamically Generating Applications from Schemas

## üß† Core Idea

SchemaFirst is an advanced platform that empowers developers to create dynamic applications using a "Schema First" approach. By defining schemas visually, the system automatically generates databases, APIs, and user interfaces, enabling you to build entire systems without manually coding models or controllers. This dynamic and flexible platform adapts to any requirement, whether it's backend, frontend, or full-stack development.

## üåÄ Flexible Usage Modes

- üß© **Backend Only**: Utilize SchemaFirst as a powerful, customizable backend server with automatic model generation.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Frontend Only**: Seamlessly connect Angular or Flutter frontends to any existing API with auto-generated UI components.
- üîÅ **Backend + Frontend (Default)**: Enjoy a fully integrated solution where the backend and frontend are in sync, both auto-generated based on your schemas.

---

## üåê Multilingual & Internationalization

SchemaFirst fully supports internationalization (i18n):

- **Multilingual Fields**: Define default languages for fields and models.
- **Dynamic Translations**: Translations are handled dynamically per user.
- **Admin Control**: Easily manage translations, including custom field translations, from the admin panel.

## üöÄ Why SchemaFirst?

- ‚úÖ Build comprehensive systems without manually writing models or controllers.
- ‚úÖ Automatically generate UI components (Forms, Tables, Cards) based on schema definitions.
- ‚úÖ Full support for both Web and Mobile (Angular + Flutter).
- ‚úÖ Scalable microservices architecture with easy protocol integration.
- ‚úÖ Built-in multilingual and localization capabilities.
- ‚úÖ Live synchronization of schema changes across backend and frontend.
- ‚úÖ Centralized API management and custom protocol handling.

## üîå Multi-Protocol API Support

SchemaFirst supports a variety of communication protocols:

- üåê REST
- üîç GraphQL
- üßº SOAP
- ‚ö° WebSocket
- üì° Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- üõ∞Ô∏è gRPC
- üì¶ MessagePack

> Admins can enable or disable protocols for each model or service, with full configuration available through a dynamic dashboard.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Visual Schema Definition**: Define schemas through the GUI.
2. **Schema Storage**: Schemas are stored in a unified central database (AdminDB).
3. **Auto-Generation**: Both backend and frontend code are automatically generated based on the schema.
4. **Real-time Sync**: Any schema updates immediately reflect across both backend and frontend.
5. **Protocol Flexibility**: Choose and enable communication protocols per service, with auto-generated documentation.
